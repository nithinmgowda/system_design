# URL Shortener Interview Explanation Guide

## 1. Start with the Problem Statement (30 seconds)

**"We need to build a service like TinyURL that takes long URLs and converts them to short ones."**

**Example:** 
- Input: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5WRWNW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=wireless+headphones`
- Output: `https://tiny.ly/abc123`

**Key Requirements:**
- Shorten URLs
- Redirect users when they click short URLs
- Handle millions of URLs
- Fast response time

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture (1-2 minutes)

### Basic Flow:
```
User → Load Balancer → Web Servers → Database
                           ↓
                       Cache Layer
```

**Explain in simple terms:**
1. **User comes to our website** - wants to shorten a URL
2. **Load balancer** - distributes traffic (like a traffic cop)
3. **Web servers** - handle the actual requests
4. **Database** - stores the mapping between short and long URLs
5. **Cache** - keeps popular URLs in memory for speed

---

## 3. Core Components (2-3 minutes)

### A. URL Shortening Service
**"When someone gives us a long URL:"**
1. Generate a unique short code (like "abc123")
2. Save the mapping: `abc123 → original_long_url`
3. Return the short URL

### B. URL Resolution Service
**"When someone clicks a short URL:"**
1. Extract the short code ("abc123")
2. Look it up in our database
3. Redirect them to the original URL

### C. Database Design
**Simple table structure:**
```
URLs Table:
- short_code (Primary Key)
- original_url
- created_date
- click_count
```

## 4. Key Technical Decisions (2-3 minutes)

### A. How to Generate Short Codes?
**Option 1: Random Generation**
- Generate random 6-7 character strings
- Check if it already exists
- If yes, generate another one

**Option 2: Counter-based**
- Use auto-incrementing counter
- Convert number to Base62 (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- More predictable, no collisions

### B. Database Choice
**SQL Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL):**
- Good for: Consistency, relationships
- Simple queries: "Give me URL for code X"

### C. Caching Strategy
**Redis for hot data:**
- Keep most popular URLs in memory
- 10x faster than database lookup
- Cache popular URLs for hours/days

---

## 5. Scale Considerations (1-2 minutes)

### Traffic Patterns:
- **Read-heavy system** (more clicks than URL creation)
- **100:1 ratio** - 100 redirects for every 1 URL created

### Scaling Solutions:
1. **Cache popular URLs** - 80% of traffic hits 20% of URLs
2. **Database replicas** - Multiple read-only copies
3. **Load balancers** - Handle traffic spikes
4. **CDN** - Serve from locations close to users

---

## 6. Follow-up Questions & Answers

### Q: "How do you handle millions of URLs?"
**A:** "Horizontal scaling - add more servers and database replicas. Use sharding if needed."

### Q: "What if two users get the same short code?"
**A:** "Use atomic operations in database or check-and-retry logic. Very rare with 62^7 combinations."

### Q: "How do you track analytics?"
**A:** "Log every click to a separate analytics database. Process in background for reports."

### Q: "What about security?"
**A:** "Validate URLs, rate limiting, check for malicious sites, use HTTPS."

## 7. Interview Tips

### Do:
- **Start simple** - basic flow first, then add complexity
- **Think out loud** - explain your reasoning
- **Ask clarifying questions** - "Should we support custom aliases?"
- **Consider trade-offs** - "We could do X but it would impact Y"

### Don't:
- Jump into complex details immediately
- Forget about the user experience
- Ignore scalability questions
- Over-engineer the initial solution

### Key Phrases to Use:
- "Let's start with the basic flow..."
- "For scale, we would need..."
- "The trade-off here is..."
- "A simple approach would be..."
- "To handle millions of requests..."

## 8. Sample 5-Minute Walkthrough

**Minutes 1-2:** Problem statement + basic architecture
**Minutes 3-4:** Core services (shortening + resolution)
**Minutes 5:** Scaling considerations + follow-up questions

**Remember:** Keep it conversational, draw diagrams if possible, and always relate technical decisions back to user needs!
