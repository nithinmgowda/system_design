# Unified Payments Interface (UPI) - System Design Interview Guide

## 1. Start with the Problem Statement (30 seconds)

**"We need to design UPI - a real-time payment system that lets people transfer money instantly using just a phone number or UPI ID."**

**The Problem UPI Solves:**
- Bank transfers take hours/days
- Need bank account details (IFSC, account number)
- Multiple payment apps don't work together
- Cash transactions are inconvenient

**What UPI Does:**
- Instant money transfer (24/7)
- Use simple IDs like `user@paytm` or phone numbers
- Works across all banks and payment apps
- Single interface for all payment needs

**Key Requirements:**
- Real-time transactions (within seconds)
- High security and fraud prevention
- 99.9%+ availability
- Handle millions of transactions daily
- Interoperability between different apps

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture (1-2 minutes)

### Basic Flow:
```
Payment App → UPI Switch (NPCI) → Beneficiary Bank → Account Credited
     ↓              ↓                    ↑
Payer Bank ← Authentication ← Validation ← Response
```

**Explain in simple terms:**
1. **User initiates payment** in any UPI app (PhonePe, GPay, Paytm)
2. **App sends request** to user's bank
3. **Bank validates** user and account balance
4. **UPI Switch (NPCI)** routes payment to recipient's bank
5. **Recipient bank** credits money to account
6. **Confirmation** sent back to both users

---

## 3. Core Components (2-3 minutes)

### A. UPI Switch (NPCI - National Payments Corporation)
**"Central hub that connects all banks and apps:"**
- Routes payments between different banks
- Maintains UPI ID registry (`user@bank` mappings)
- Handles transaction validation and fraud checks
- Ensures interoperability between all UPI apps

### B. Payment Service Provider (PSP)
**"UPI apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm:"**
- User interface for payments
- Account linking and management
- Transaction history and receipts
- Additional features (bill payments, rewards)

### C. Bank Systems
**"Actual money movement happens here:"**
- Account validation and balance checks
- Debit/credit operations
- Real-time transaction processing
- Regulatory compliance and reporting

### D. UPI ID Management
**"Directory service for user identities:"**
```
UPI ID Mapping:
- upi_id: "john@paytm"
- bank_account: "1234567890"
- bank_ifsc: "HDFC0001234" 
- user_mobile: "+919876543210"
- status: "ACTIVE"
```

## 4. Key Technical Decisions (2-3 minutes)

### A. Transaction Flow Design
**Two-Phase Commit Pattern:**
1. **Reserve Phase**: Check balance, reserve money in payer account
2. **Commit Phase**: Debit payer, credit beneficiary
3. **Rollback**: If anything fails, reverse all operations

**Why this matters:** Ensures money is never lost or duplicated

### B. UPI ID Resolution
**How `user@paytm` becomes actual bank account:**
```
Step 1: user@paytm → NPCI registry lookup
Step 2: Find bank: "HDFC Bank, Account: 1234567890"
Step 3: Route payment to HDFC Bank systems
Step 4: HDFC processes the actual money transfer
```

### C. Security Architecture
**Multi-layer Security:**
- **Device binding** - UPI PIN tied to specific phone
- **Two-factor authentication** - PIN + mobile number
- **Encryption** - All data encrypted in transit
- **Fraud detection** - Real-time transaction monitoring
- **Rate limiting** - Prevent too many transactions per user

### D. Real-time Processing
**Message Queue Architecture:**
- **High-priority queue** - Person-to-person transfers
- **Medium-priority** - Merchant payments
- **Low-priority** - Bill payments, bulk transfers
- **Retry mechanism** - Handle temporary failures

## 5. Database Design (1-2 minutes)

### UPI Registry Database (NPCI):
```sql
-- UPI ID Registry
CREATE TABLE upi_registry (
    upi_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    bank_code VARCHAR(10),
    account_number VARCHAR(20),
    mobile_number VARCHAR(15),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    created_date DATETIME
);

-- Transaction Log
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    payer_upi_id VARCHAR(100),
    payee_upi_id VARCHAR(100),
    amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp DATETIME,
    reference_id VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Bank Database:
```sql
-- Account Information
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_number VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(20),
    balance DECIMAL(15,2),
    account_type VARCHAR(20),
    status VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Transaction History
CREATE TABLE account_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    account_number VARCHAR(20),
    transaction_type VARCHAR(10), -- DEBIT/CREDIT
    amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    reference_id VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp DATETIME
);
```

## 6. Scale Considerations (1-2 minutes)

### Traffic Patterns:
- **Peak hours** - 9 AM, 6 PM (salary day spikes)
- **Festival seasons** - 10x normal volume
- **Geographic distribution** - Different peak times across India
- **Transaction types** - 70% P2P, 20% merchant, 10% bills

### Scaling Solutions:
1. **Horizontal scaling** - Multiple UPI switch instances
2. **Database sharding** - Partition by bank or region
3. **Caching layer** - Cache UPI ID mappings
4. **Load balancing** - Distribute across bank systems
5. **Async processing** - Queue non-critical operations

### High Availability:
- **Multi-region deployment** - Primary + backup data centers
- **Bank redundancy** - Multiple connection paths to each bank
- **Circuit breakers** - Isolate failing components
- **Graceful degradation** - Core payments work even if features fail

## 7. Follow-up Questions & Answers

### Q: "How do you ensure transaction consistency across banks?"
**A:** "Use distributed transaction protocols, maintain transaction logs, implement compensation actions for failures, and have reconciliation processes."

### Q: "What if UPI Switch (NPCI) goes down?"
**A:** "Multiple data centers with failover, real-time replication, circuit breakers to isolate issues, and backup transaction processing queues."

### Q: "How do you handle fraud detection?"
**A:** "Real-time ML models for anomaly detection, velocity checks, device fingerprinting, and behavioral analysis. Block suspicious transactions immediately."

### Q: "What about regulatory compliance?"
**A:** "Transaction limits (₹1 lakh/day), KYC verification, audit trails, regulatory reporting, and data retention policies."

### Q: "How do you handle disputes?"
**A:** "Complete transaction audit trail, automated refund processes, customer support integration, and bank-level resolution mechanisms."

## 13. Student-Friendly Analogies

**UPI Switch = Post Office System:**
- You write letter (transaction) with address (UPI ID)
- Post office (NPCI) reads address and routes to right city
- Local post office (bank) delivers to specific house (account)
- Tracking number (transaction ID) lets you follow progress

**UPI ID = Email Address:**
- Easy to remember (`john@gmail.com` vs `john@paytm`)
- Works across different email providers
- Behind the scenes, complex routing happens
- User just needs to know the simple address

**Payment Apps = Different Email Clients:**
- Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail (different interfaces)
- All can send emails to each other
- Same underlying email protocol (like UPI protocol)
- User chooses preferred interface

**Remember:** Use these analogies to make UPI concepts accessible to non-technical interviewers too!
